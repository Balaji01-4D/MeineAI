# MEINEAI

**MEINEAI** is a powerful CLI Python tool designed for file and system management. It allows users to execute operations like file creation, deletion, moving, copying, and more, while also providing detailed system information. Utilizing NLP, MEINEAI can understand and interpret user commands to perform tasks such as identifying file names and specific operations.

## Features

- **File Operations**: Create, delete, move, and copy files with ease.
- **System Information**: Displays detailed information about CPU, GPU, memory, disk partitions, network, environmental variables, and more.
- **NLP Integration**: Understands user commands and extracts relevant information for seamless task execution.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean, tabulated display with the help of `tabulate` and `rich` modules.
